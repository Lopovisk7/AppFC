Fix all issues related to large PDF uploads in the LpKards app.

CURRENT PROBLEM
- PDF upload fails with "file too large"
- Large PDFs may crash or hang the app
- PDF text extraction is not robust for big files

GOAL
Allow users to upload and process VERY LARGE PDFs safely and completely.

REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

1. UPLOAD SIZE CONFIGURATION
- Configure Flask to allow large uploads (at least 100 MB)
- Explicitly set MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH
- Do NOT hard-block files by size unless absolutely necessary
- If the limit is exceeded, show a clear, user-friendly message

2. MEMORY-SAFE PDF PROCESSING
- Refactor PDF text extraction to process files page-by-page
- Do NOT load the entire PDF into memory at once
- Use streaming / incremental reading
- Ensure file handles are properly closed after processing

3. INTELLIGENT TEXT CHUNKING
- After extracting text, split content into logical chunks
- Chunk size should be based on content (≈ 2,000–3,000 words per chunk)
- Preserve paragraphs and section boundaries when possible
- Do NOT impose any global character limit
- Ensure 100% of the document is processed (no truncation)

4. SEQUENTIAL FLASHCARD GENERATION
- Process chunks sequentially through the flashcard generator
- Merge all generated flashcards into a single output
- Ensure chunking does NOT reduce flashcard quality

5. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING
- Gracefully handle:
  • Corrupted PDFs
  • PDFs with no extractable text
  • Encoding issues
- Display clear, actionable error messages to the user
- Never fail silently or crash the app

6. USER EXPERIENCE
- Display a non-blocking status message:
  "Processing large document, this may take a moment..."
- Ensure the UI remains responsive

CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT change flashcard logic or formats
- Do NOT modify UI layout or styling
- Do NOT introduce alternative input methods
- Do NOT reduce output quality

SCOPE
- Upload configuration
- PDF extraction logic
- Internal processing pipeline only

FINAL CHECK
- The LpKards app must successfully process very large PDFs end-to-end without errors.
